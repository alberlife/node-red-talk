You will need to import the thunder collection in VSCode or use postman with its collection.
The 3 first endpoints in the collection will get, create or delete a file called "myfile.json" inside this folder.

The 4th to last endpoints of this collection will answer with 202 Accepted status code until the 3rd request is sent and you will receive all of the responses at once.
